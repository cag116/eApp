# eApp

This app allows people to play music at events using their Spotify account, while allowing other's at the event to suggest music to a queue. It also allows many people to listen to music in sync across different devices.

This app uses Swift for the GUI, and barring any repositories used for aesthetic touches, was entirely coded by Chris Guirguis, without the use of any templates.
